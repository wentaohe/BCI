Notes
	- The lag between the dataglove position measure- ment recording and the amplifier measurement is 37ms
	- There is a characteristic delay between brain activ-ity and resulting finger movement.
	- The glove data is supersampled. original sampling frequecy is 40 hz. 


	- Kubanek paper shows ECoG data in 70-200 Hz band to be most useful
	- Optimal performance achieved when using data preceeding actual movement by 50-100 ms
	- 6 Features for each electrode using 100 ms windows from ECoG Data:
		5 average spectral amplitudes for 8-12, 18-24, 75-115, 125-159, 159-175 Hz
		Local Motor Potential (LMP): Running average of raw time-domain signal
